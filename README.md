Tool for procedural generation of aircraft skin. The procedure takes positions and simple geometric descriptions of elements such as engines or cockpits and produces aerodynamic skins that envelope all given elements. The process produces meshes in a few milliseconds, and the resulting meshes can be directly used for calculating aerodynamic forces.
